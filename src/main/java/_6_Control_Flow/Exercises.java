/*        6. Control Flow Exercises
1. Write a method in 4 lines of code (not including method name/signature
& curly braces) that outputs the days of the week, one per line, using
a regular ‘for-loop’ and an array.
  1.1 Do it again using the enhanced ‘for-loop’.
  1.2 Do it again but make every other output line fully capitalized.
Sunday
MONDAY
Tuesday
WEDNESDAY
etc…
  1.3. Do it again but use only 4 lines of code (not including method and curly braces of
method.
A: WeekDaysFor

2. Repeat all parts of exercise #1, but use ‘while-loop’ instead of
 ‘for-loop’ (where applicable).
 A: WeekDaysWhile

3. Do #2 again but use a ‘do-while-loop’. (No solutions provided for this one)
A: WeekDaysDoWhile

4. Use an array of days of the week, enhanced ‘for-loop’ and if/else to create
   the following output.
We eat pot roast on Sunday
We eat spaghetti on Monday
We eat tacos on Tuesday
We eat chicken on Wednesday
We eat meatloaf on Thursday
We eat hamburgers on Friday
We eat pizza on Saturday
A: MealsWeekFor

5. Repeat exercise #4 but instead of if/else, use traditional switch/case.
A: MealsWeekSwitchTrad

6. Repeat exercise #5 but use newer switch expression with as little repetition
as possible.
   6.1. Add a private method that can capitalize the first letter of each word
   of the meal. So, instead of “We eat spaghetti on Sunday”, it would print,
    “We eat Spaghetti on Sunday”. Do not just capitalize the meal names
    yourself. Let your new method do it for you.
  6.2 Improve on 6.1 to make it smart enough to output: “We eat Pot Roast on
   Sunday”, i.e., it should capitalize each word of a multi-word meal name.
A: MealsWeekSwitchNewer

7. Iterate over all the days of the week in an array and add up the total number of characters
in all the days of the week. E.g., “Sunday”=6, “Monday”=6, etc. therefore, answer should
be 50.
A: Exercise7

8. Use Regex with named parameters and a loop to parse the addresses below and print out
the street address, city, state & postal code. Transfer this list of addresses into your
program using a Java text block “”” String.
12345 First Street, First City, AA 90210
22222 Second Street, Second City, BB 22222
33333 Third Street, Third City, CC 33333
44444 Fourth Street, Fourth City, DD 44444
55555 Fifth Street, Fifth City, EE 55555
66666 Sixth Street, Sixth City, FF 66666
77777 Seventh Street, Seventh City, GG 77777
88888 Eighth Street, Eighth City, HH 88888
99999 Ninth Street, Ninth City, II 99999
00000 Tenth Street, Tenth City, JJ 00000
